The project is to research, analyse, and investigate the key contributors of plastic pollution, which has become a big infamous problem 
in the globe today, as well as to describe our platform design, which aims to help in minimizing the issue of floating trash. Annually, more than 2 million tons of plastic have been thrown into bodies of water and finally dumped into the sea. Not only do living marine critters become targets and carriers of deadly viruses, but some marine animals die directly as a result of plastic ingestion. There are many detrimental effects of plastic pollution on the environment and society. This study's methodology, classification of trash-cleaning techniques, and efforts to address the issue are all included. To distinguish between their efficacies, static and dynamic systems have been divided into categories. With regard to this study, the suggested design will concentrate on a dynamic system that is completely autonomous.It has multiple functions and incorporates various kinds of sensors.This essay also highlights how new and distinctive the suggested design is in comparison to others, both in terms of its architecture and its functioning.

### PURPOSE
The purpose of this report is to provide an overview and analysis of the Scavenger Boat, a 
unique and innovative watercraft designed for scavenging and cleaning water bodies. The 
report explores the key features, functionality, benefits, and potential applications of the 
Scavenger Boat, as well as its impact on environmental conservation and waste management.
The Scavenger Boat is a specialized watercraft equipped with advanced technologies and tools 
to efficiently collect, sort, and manage waste and debris from water bodies such as rivers, lakes, 
and oceans. It incorporates a combination of mechanical, electrical, and digital systems to 
streamline the cleaning process and promote environmental sustainability

### OBJECTIVES OF THE RESEARCH
The main objective of the research work conducted by the authors was to address the 
issue of floating water waste in water reservoirs and develop an efficient and automated system 
for its collection. The authors aimed to design a simple yet effective system that could 
effectively gather and remove floating debris and pollutants from water bodies.
